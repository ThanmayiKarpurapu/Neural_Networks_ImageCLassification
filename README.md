# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview
- Uses the MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images of digits 0–9)
- Builds a neural network using Keras
- Trains and evaluates the model on unseen test data
- Visualizes performance using a confusion matrix
- Shows improvement by adding a hidden layer

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
2. Normalize and flatten image data
3. Build and train a neural network model
4. Evaluate model performance using test data
5. Generate predictions and analyze results with a confusion matrix

## Results
- Basic model achieves ~92% test accuracy
- Model with a hidden layer improves accuracy to ~97%
- Confusion matrix shows most predictions along the diagonal, indicating good performance

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the notebook or Python script

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline for image classification and shows how model complexity impacts performance.
